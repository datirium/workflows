FastQC - a quality control tool for high throughput sequence data
=====================================

FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming
from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use
to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before
doing any further analysis.

The main functions of FastQC are:

- Import of data from FastQ files (any variant)
- Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems
- Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
- Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
- Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without running the interactive application
