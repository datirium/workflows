Super-enhancers, consist of clusters of enhancers that are densely occupied by the master regulators and Mediator.
Super-enhancers differ from typical enhancers in size, transcription factor density and content, ability to activate transcription,
and sensitivity to perturbation.

Use to create stitched enhancers, and to separate super-enhancers from typical enhancers using sequencing data (.bam) given a file of previously identified constituent enhancers (.gff)
