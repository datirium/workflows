  Tool calculates statistics on the base of FASTQ file quality scores.
  If `output_filename` is not provided call function `default_output_filename` to return default output file name
  generated as `input_file` basename + `.fastxstat` extension.

s:about: |
  usage: fastx_quality_stats [-h] [-N] [-i INFILE] [-o OUTFILE]
  Part of FASTX Toolkit 0.0.14 by A. Gordon (assafgordon@gmail.com)
     [-h] = This helpful help screen.
     [-i INFILE]  = FASTQ input file. default is STDIN.
     [-o OUTFILE] = TEXT output file. default is STDOUT.
     [-N]         = New output format (with more information per nucleotide/cycle).
  The *OLD* output TEXT file will have the following fields (one row per column):
  	column	= column number (1 to 36 for a 36-cycles read solexa file)
  	count   = number of bases found in this column.
  	min     = Lowest quality score value found in this column.
  	max     = Highest quality score value found in this column.
  	sum     = Sum of quality score values for this column.
  	mean    = Mean quality score value for this column.
  	Q1	= 1st quartile quality score.
  	med	= Median quality score.
  	Q3	= 3rd quartile quality score.
  	IQR	= Inter-Quartile range (Q3-Q1).
  	lW	= 'Left-Whisker' value (for boxplotting).
  	rW	= 'Right-Whisker' value (for boxplotting).
  	A_Count	= Count of 'A' nucleotides found in this column.
  	C_Count	= Count of 'C' nucleotides found in this column.
  	G_Count	= Count of 'G' nucleotides found in this column.
  	T_Count	= Count of 'T' nucleotides found in this column.
  	N_Count = Count of 'N' nucleotides found in this column.
  	max-count = max. number of bases (in all cycles)
  The *NEW* output format:
  	cycle (previously called 'column') = cycle number
  	max-count
    For each nucleotide in the cycle (ALL/A/C/G/T/N):
  		count   = number of bases found in this column.
  		min     = Lowest quality score value found in this column.
  		max     = Highest quality score value found in this column.
  		sum     = Sum of quality score values for this column.
  		mean    = Mean quality score value for this column.
  		Q1	= 1st quartile quality score.
  		med	= Median quality score.
  		Q3	= 3rd quartile quality score.
  		IQR	= Inter-Quartile range (Q3-Q1).
  		lW	= 'Left-Whisker' value (for boxplotting).
  		rW	= 'Right-Whisker' value (for boxplotting).
