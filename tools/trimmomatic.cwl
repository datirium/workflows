  illuminaclip_step_param:

    doc: |
      <fastaWithAdaptersEtc>:<seed mismatches>:<palindrome clip threshold>:<simple clip threshold>:<minAdapterLength>:<keepBothReads>
      Find and remove Illumina adapters.
      REQUIRED:
      <fastaWithAdaptersEtc>: specifies the path to a fasta file containing all the adapters, PCR sequences etc.
      The naming of the various sequences within this file determines how they are used. See below.
      <seedMismatches>: specifies the maximum mismatch count which will still allow a full match to be performed
      <palindromeClipThreshold>: specifies how accurate the match between the two 'adapter ligated' reads must be
      for PE palindrome read alignment.
      <simpleClipThreshold>: specifies how accurate the match between any adapter etc. sequence must be against a read
      OPTIONAL:
      <minAdapterLength>: In addition to the alignment score, palindrome mode can verify
      that a minimum length of adapter has been detected. If unspecified, this defaults to 8 bases,
      for historical reasons. However, since palindrome mode has a very low false positive rate, this
      can be safely reduced, even down to 1, to allow shorter adapter fragments to be removed.
      <keepBothReads>: After read-though has been detected by palindrome mode, and the
      adapter sequence removed, the reverse read contains the same sequence information as the
      forward read, albeit in reverse complement. For this reason, the default behaviour is to
      entirely drop the reverse read. By specifying „true‟ for this parameter, the reverse read will
      also be retained, which may be useful e.g. if the downstream tools cannot handle a
      combination of paired and unpaired reads.

      <windowSize>:<requiredQuality>
      Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls
      below a threshold. By considering multiple bases, a single poor quality base will not cause the
      removal of high quality data later in the read.

    doc: |
      <quality>
      Remove low quality bases from the beginning. As long as a base has a value below this
      threshold the base is removed and the next base will be investigated.
      <quality>: Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base.
  trailing_step:

    inputBinding:
      position: 103
      prefix: 'TRAILING:'
      separate: false
    doc: |
      <quality>
      Remove low quality bases from the end. As long as a base has a value below this threshold
      the base is removed and the next base (which as trimmomatic is starting from the 3‟ prime end
      would be base preceding the just removed base) will be investigated. This approach can be
      used removing the special illumina „low quality segment‟ regions (which are marked with
      quality score of 2), but we recommend Sliding Window or MaxInfo instead
      <quality>: Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base.

      <length>
      Removes bases regardless of quality from the end of the read, so that the read has maximally
      the specified length after this step has been performed. Steps performed after CROP might of
      course further shorten the read.

      <length>
      This module removes reads that fall below the specified minimal length. If required, it should
      normally be after all other processing steps. Reads removed by this step will be counted and
      included in the „dropped reads‟ count presented in the trimmomatic summary.

  Tool runs trimmomatic with ILLUMINACLIP step by default.

  `-basein` and `-baseout` inputs are skipped.

  If set `lib_type` to `PE`, both of the inputs `fastq_file_upstream` and `fastq_file_downstream` shoul be provided.

  If input `trigger` is set to `true` or isn't set at all (`true` is used by default), run `trimmomatic` and return
  FASTQ file[s] with trimmed adapters, alongside with the uppaired reads FASTQ files (if `lib_type` is set to `PE` and
  such files are present after running `trimmomatic`)
  If input `trigger` is set to `false`, return unchanged `fastq_file_upstream` and `fastq_file_downstream`, previously
  staged into output directory.

  Before execution `baseCommand`, `fastq_file_upstream` and `fastq_file_downstream` (if provided) are staged into directory
  set as docker parameter `--workdir` (tool's output directory), using `InitialWorkDirRequirement`. They are mount
  to docker container with `ro` mode as part of `--workdir`, because all generated files will have `trimmed` suffix
  in their names, so the staged files will not be overwritten.

  Trigger logic is implemented in a bash scripts set by default as `bash_script` input. If the first argument $0 (which is
  `trigger` input) is true, run `trimmomatic` with the rest of the arguments. If $0 is not true, skip `trimmomatic` and
  return `fastq_file_upstream` and `fastq_file_downstream` (if provided) staged into output directory.

  Input `trigger` is Boolean, but returns String, because of `valueFrom` field. The `valueFrom` is used, because if `trigger`
  is false, cwl-runner doesn't append this argument at all to the the `baseCommand` - new feature of CWL v1.0.2. Alternatively,
  `prefix` field could be used, but it causes changing in script logic.

  `default_output_name` function is used for generating output filename based on `input_file.basename` and provided
  extension.
