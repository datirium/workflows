Differential Binding Analysis of ChIP-Seq Peak Data
---------------------------------------------------

DiffBind processes ChIP-Seq data enriched for genomic loci where specific protein/DNA binding occurs, including peak sets identified by ChIP-Seq peak callers and
aligned sequence read datasets. It is designed to work with multiple peak sets simultaneously, representing different ChIP experiments (antibodies, transcription
factor and/or histone marks, experimental conditions, replicates) as well as managing the results of multiple peak callers.
