## Bioinformatics Workflows by Datirium LLC

ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq, CLIP-Seq, RNA-Seq CWL workflows for use in [Scientific Data Analysis Platform (SciDAP)](https://scidap.com)
or in [BioWardrobe](https://biowardrobe.com/) project or standalone with [cwltool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool).

All the original BioWardrobe's [pipelines](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0720-3)
    has been rewritten in CWL and new workflows has been added.  The repository pulls automatically into SciDAP platform.
