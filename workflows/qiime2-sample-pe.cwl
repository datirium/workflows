    doc: |
      For libraries sequenced on the Illumina platform itâ€™s recommended to remove adapter sequences
      from the reads. If adapters are not trimmed there is a high risk of reads being unmapped to a
      reference genome. This becomes particularly important when the reads are long and the fragments
      are short - resulting in sequencing adapters at the end of a read. If adapter trimming will cause
      all the reads to become too short (<30bp), this step will be skipped.

doc: |
  A workflow for processing a single 16S sample via a QIIME2 pipeline.

  ## __Outputs__
  #### Output files:
    - overview.md, list of inputs
    - demux.qzv, summary visualizations of imported data
    - alpha-rarefaction.qzv, plot of OTU rarefaction
    - taxa-bar-plots.qzv, relative frequency of taxomonies barplot

  ## __Inputs__
  #### General Info
   - Sample short name/Alias: Used for samplename in downstream analyses. Ensure this is the same name used in the metadata samplesheet.
   - Environment: where the sample was collected
   - Catalog No.: catalog number if available (optional)
   - Read 1 FASTQ file: Read 1 FASTQ file from a paired-end sequencing run.
   - Read 2 FASTQ file: Read 2 FASTQ file that pairs with the input R1 file.
   - Trim 5' of R1: Recommended if adapters are still on the input sequences. Trims the first J bases from the 5' end of each forward read.
   - Trim 5' of R2: Recommended if adapters are still on the input sequences. Trims the first K bases from the 5' end of each reverse read.
   - Truncate 3' of R1: Recommended if quality drops off along the length of the read. Clips the forward read starting M bases from the 5' end (before trimming).
   - Truncate 3' of R2: Recommended if quality drops off along the length of the read. Clips the reverse read starting N bases from the 5' end (before trimming).
   - Threads: Number of threads to use for steps that support multithreading.

  ### __Data Analysis Steps__
  1. Generate FASTX quality statistics for visualization of unmapped, raw FASTQ reads.
  2. Import the data, make a qiime artifact (demux.qza), and summary visualization process will additionally filter any phiX reads (commonly present in marker gene Illumina sequence data) that are identified in the sequencing data, and will filter chimeric sequences.
  4. Generate a phylogenetic tree for diversity analyses and rarefaction processing and plotting.
  5. Taxonomy classification of amplicons. Performed using a Naive Bayes classifier trained on the Greengenes2 database "gg_2022_10_backbone_full_length.nb.qza".
