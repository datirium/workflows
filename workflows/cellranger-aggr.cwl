  Single Cell Aggregate
  =====================

  Workflow calls "cellranger aggr" command to combine output files from "cellranger count"
  (the molecule_info.h5 file from each run) into a single feature-barcode matrix containing
  all the data. When combining multiple GEM wells, the barcode sequences for each channel
  are distinguished by a GEM well suffix appended to the barcode sequence. Each GEM well is
  a physically distinct set of GEM partitions, but draws barcode sequences randomly from the
  pool of valid barcodes, known as the barcode whitelist. To keep the barcodes unique when
  aggregating multiple libraries, we append a small integer identifying the GEM well to the
  barcode nucleotide sequence, and use that nucleotide sequence plus ID as the unique identifier
  in the feature-barcode matrix. For example, AGACCATTGAGACTTA-1 and AGACCATTGAGACTTA-2 are
  distinct cell barcodes from different GEM wells, despite having the same barcode nucleotide
  sequence. This number, which tells us which GEM well this barcode sequence came from, is
  called the GEM well suffix. The numbering of the GEM wells will reflect the order that the
  GEM wells were provided in the "molecule_info_h5" and "gem_well_labels" inputs.

  When combining data from multiple GEM wells, the "cellranger aggr" pipeline automatically
  equalizes the average read depth per cell between groups before merging. This approach avoids
  artifacts that may be introduced due to differences in sequencing depth. It is possible to turn
  off normalization or change the way normalization is done through the "normalization_mode"
  input. The "none" value may be appropriate if you want to maximize sensitivity and plan to deal
  with depth normalization in a downstream step.
